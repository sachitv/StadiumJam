This is a simple demo where a player can go up on stage and play some music
The crowd responds to the playersâ€™ music
When the player comes up on stage, the crowd claps to welcome him
They start dancing when he starts playing the music
When he finishes playing the music they start clapping.
When he leaves, they go back to idling.
